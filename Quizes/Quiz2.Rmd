## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
hist(MutualFunds$'Mutual funds', breaks = 5, main = "Histogram" , "col"="violet", xlab = "Mutual Funds")
```


```{r}
stem(BodyTemperature$`Body temperature`, scale = 1 )
```

```{r}
hist(Question6$Dataset, breaks = 5, col = "blue", xlab = "Dataset", main = "Dataset")


```

```{r}
hist(Ratings$'Satisfaction', main = "Histogram" , "col"="violet", xlab = "Ratings")

```



```{r}
plot(PolygonQ6$'y' ~ PolygonQ6$'x', "col"="red", ylab="Relative Frequency", xlab="Dataset")

lines("col"="green", PolygonQ6$'y' ~ PolygonQ6$'x')
```


```{r}
stem(DatasetQ7$Dataset, scale = 1)
```


```{r}
hist(Question8$'Dataset', breaks = 6 , main = "Histogram" , "col"="violet", xlab = "Ratings")

hist(Question8$'Dataset', breaks = c(3,5,7,9,11,13,15), freq = TRUE,
     main = "WRONG histogram", col = "blue", bor = "white")
```



```{r}
mean(Quiz3Q9$Data)

sd(Quiz3Q9$Data)

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
